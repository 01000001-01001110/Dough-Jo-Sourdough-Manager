# Privacy Policy for Dough Jo

**Last Updated: August 24, 2024**

## Your Privacy Matters

Dough Jo is designed with privacy at its core. This policy explains how we handle your data - spoiler alert: we don't collect, store, or access any of your personal information.

## Data Collection

**We collect ZERO data about you.**

Dough Jo does not:
- Collect personal information
- Track your usage or behavior
- Store data on external servers
- Use analytics or telemetry
- Require account creation or sign-up
- Access your contacts, location, or other device data
- Use cookies or tracking technologies

## How Your Data is Stored

**Everything stays on your device.**

- All starter recipes, feeding records, and notes are stored locally on your device using Apple's Core Data framework
- Your data never leaves your device unless YOU explicitly choose to export it
- No cloud storage, no server backups, no remote access
- When you delete the app, all your data is permanently removed from your device

## Data Export & Sharing

**You have complete control.**

- Export feature creates CSV files locally on your device
- These files are only shared when YOU choose to share them via iOS's built-in sharing system
- Exported files contain only the sourdough data you've entered
- We never see or have access to your exported data

## Third-Party Services

**We use none.**

Dough Jo does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, advertising networks, or cloud services.

## Children's Privacy

Since we collect no data whatsoever, our app is safe for users of all ages. No personal information is ever collected from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change our privacy practices (which would only be to maintain our zero-data-collection approach), we'll update this policy and notify users through an app update.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can contact us at:

**Email:** [Your contact email]

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect your data, there's nothing for us to:
- Delete (it's already only on your device)
- Correct (you manage it directly)
- Export (you can export it yourself)
- Access (we never could anyway)

**Bottom line:** Your sourdough journey is completely private. We believe great bread comes from great ingredients, not great surveillance.
